# Deals DB

## Overview
This multipart project is designed to provide practice with software tools and languages. Each short assignment applies what you have learned in the classroom that week. __Do not do assignments until they are assigned. They may change at any time until they are formally assigned.__

__You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers.__ However, you are also responsible for learning the key lessons of each assignment. So, if you need help, ask for it and pay attention to the answers. If you know how to help someone (without doing the work for them), then please help them out.
